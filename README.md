# TIC TAC TOE V1

Second Version of a Small Game Implementing a smart (AI) Computer Opponent Using the C++ Programming Language. Updated--Implemented Minimax Algorithm

Improvements from V0:

//Design structure is more fluid. Implemented a constructor to set default gamestate, enums to enclose player markes, and structs for the size of the board/move object.

//Computer now uses minimax alogrithm to make a move by playing out every gamestate using recursion and playing optimally

//Computer moves in order to maximize score

//The game play was placed into its own function and removed from main.cpp

Goal for future Versions:

//May try to implement pruning strategy to eliminate having to go through every possible gamestate whihc will save on resources

//May try to implement an inheritance hierarchy and sperate board, player and game into seperate classes

//May try to deploy android app

//All in all satisfied with this implementation
